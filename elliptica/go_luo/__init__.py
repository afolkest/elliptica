Experimental Luo–Qian style geometric‑optics solvers.

This package is intentionally isolated from the main PDE stack while the
numerical schemes are being developed and validated. Nothing here is wired
into the public API or UI; scripts under ``scripts/`` are expected to import
these helpers directly for R&D and testing.
